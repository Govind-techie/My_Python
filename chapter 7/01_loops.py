# print no. 1 to 1000

print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)

# and so on

# we can perform this same task in much efficient way using loops

# Note : This is a for loop

for i in range (1,1001): # loops work based on indexing in which we determine the range for a loop for how many time a loop should be repeat itself
    print(i)

# Note : we have to give range 1 less than the time we have to perform a loop
# eg. range(1,6) : in this loop will repeat itself 5 times
